Editorial suggestions for improving the final draft.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Grammar Issues




## Clarity Issues

• The description of the sun's heat could be more evocative.
• The transition between the introduction of Vijay and his training of Rohan could be smoother.
• The phrase "gilded cage" is a bit cliché; a more original metaphor could be used.
• The description of the final match could be more detailed and engaging.
• The ending could be more impactful, focusing on the lasting changes in Palampur


## Style Suggestions

• Instead of 'near-lethal temperature,' use more vivid language to describe the heat, like 'baked the pitch to a shimmering, almost unbearable temperature.'
• Show, don't tell. Instead of saying Rohan's skills blossomed, describe specific instances of improvement.
• Use stronger verbs and more descriptive adjectives throughout.
• Explore Anika's character further, showing her support in more concrete ways.
• Enhance the imagery of Mumbai and the National Cricket Stadium to heighten the contrast with Palampur.
• Use metaphors and similes more effectively to capture the emotional depth of the narrative, for example, comparing Rohan's determination to an unyielding banyan tree or his family's disapproval to a shadow clinging to his heels.
• The final sentence could be more powerful, focusing on the lasting impact of Rohan's victory on Palampur's future


## Structural Edits

• Consider adding a scene showing Rohan's internal conflict between his passion and his family's disapproval.
• Expand on the challenges Rohan faces in Mumbai, illustrating the contrast between his humble background and the city's opulence and cutthroat competition.
• Develop Mr. Sharma's character further, adding layers of complexity beyond his 'predatory smile.'
• Create more tension and suspense leading up to the National Cricket Stadium match.
• Add a scene after the victory, showing how Rohan's success impacts the villagers and changes their views on cricket.
