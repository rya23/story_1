Editorial suggestions for improving the final draft.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Grammar Issues




## Clarity Issues




## Style Suggestions

• Enhance the description of the Martian landscape and stadium technology to create a more immersive experience. Consider using more vivid sensory details and figurative language.
• Develop the internal emotional conflicts of the characters more fully. Explore their individual grief and how it affects their actions and decisions.
• Refine the dialogue to be more concise and impactful. Use subtext and implication to convey emotion more effectively.
• Consider adding a scene showing Rohan's impact on the team before the match. This could provide context for the weight of their victory.
• Explore the thematic contrast between the excitement of the IPL victory and the profound grief they carry.  Consider using stronger metaphors and imagery to highlight this contrast


## Structural Edits

• Consider adding a scene at the beginning establishing Rohan's importance to the team and the circumstances of his death. This would provide stronger emotional context for the events of the story.
• Consider adding a scene after the match showing the team's private mourning or reflection. This could add depth to the ambiguous feelings surrounding the victory.
• You could also consider restructuring the narrative to create a more balanced pace, allowing for more detailed exploration of the characters' internal emotional states before and after the match.  Consider using flashback techniques to weave in details about Rohan's impact on the team.
