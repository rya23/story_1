[NarrativeSegment(title='The Weight of Mars', content="The Martian dust swirled around the stadium, a rusty halo encircling the roar of the crowd\n\n\nâ€”a crowd transmitted from Earth, their cheers echoing faintly in the cavernous bowl. Virat Kohli stood on the pitch, the crimson ball gleaming faintly under the artificial sun, feeling the weight of his team's impending victory as a burden. It was their first IPL trophy, a prize earned at the edge of the known world, but the taste was ash in his mouth, each thunderous applause a reminder of what was lost on Earth.  The memory of Rohan Gavaskar, their charismatic leader and friend, hung heavy in the thin Martian air.  His absence was a void at the heart of their meticulously planned success.  Devdutt, his eyes hollow and distant, stared at Rohan's holographic memorial in the locker room.  Even Mike Hesson, the steady coach, seemed to carry the weight of unspoken grief.", segment_type='description', characters_featured=['Virat Kohli', 'AB de Villiers', 'Mike Hesson'], follows_segment=None, notes=None), NarrativeSegment(title='Pre-Match Tension', content='"It feels...wrong," Devdutt said quietly, staring at the holographic image.

The Martian sun beat down, but inside the stadium, a different kind of storm brewed. Midway through their innings, the stadium lights flickered, the holographic displays of Earth-bound fans going haywire. A collective gasp rippled through the players. \n\\"Anushka, what\'s happening?" Kohli shouted over the chaos.\n"Sector 7 overload! I\'m rerouting power, but...\n\\"But what?"

The stadium erupted, but the celebration felt muted, hollow.  The victory was theirs, but the true victory was something beyond the trophy. It was in honoring Rohan\'s memory.  They had played for him, for their lost friend, and in a way, it had brought them closer together in a shared grief, a solidarity forged in the crucible of loss. In the quiet of the locker room, Devdutt looked at the memorial garden and said, "We did it," his voice barely a whisper.  Kohli stared at the same garden. "Yes," he replied, "but at what cost?
