The Martian dust swirled around the stadium, a rusty halo encircling the roar of the crowd
â€”a crowd transmitted from Earth, their cheers echoing faintly in the cavernous bowl. Virat Kohli stood on the pitch, the crimson ball gleaming faintly under the artificial sun, feeling the weight of his team's impending victory as a burden. It was their first IPL trophy, a prize earned at the edge of the known world, but the taste was ash in his mouth, each thunderous applause a reminder of what was lost on Earth.  The memory of Rohan Gavaskar, their charismatic leader and friend, hung heavy in the thin Martian air.  His absence was a void at the heart of their meticulously planned success.  Devdutt, his eyes hollow and distant, stared at Rohan's holographic memorial in the locker room.  Even Mike Hesson, the steady coach, seemed to carry the weight of unspoken grief.
"It feels...wrong," Devdutt said quietly, staring at the holographic image. "Winning like this.
\"I know," Kohli replied, his voice rough. "But we have to do it for him. For all of us."
Hesson placed a hand on Kohli's shoulder. "Focus, captain. We've trained for this. Let's honor his memory with a win."
Anushka stepped forward, her voice calm but determined. "The system checks are all clear. But keep an eye on sector 7; there's a slight power fluctuation."
The match began under a tense sky.  The Martian sun beat down, but inside the stadium, a different kind of storm brewed. Midway through their innings, the stadium lights flickered, the holographic displays of Earth-bound fans going haywire. A collective gasp rippled through the players. 
\"Anushka, what's happening?" Kohli shouted over the chaos.
"Sector 7 overload! I'm rerouting power, but...
\"But what?" Kohli demanded, his face grim.
"...there's a risk of a complete system failure. We need to finish this inning quickly."
Against all odds, RCB won.  The stadium erupted, but the celebration felt muted, hollow.  The victory was theirs, but the true victory was something beyond the trophy. It was in honoring Rohan's memory.  They had played for him, for their lost friend, and in a way, it had brought them closer together in a shared grief, a solidarity forged in the crucible of loss. In the quiet of the locker room, Devdutt looked at the memorial garden and said, "We did it," his voice barely a whisper.  Kohli stared at the same garden. "Yes," he replied, "but at what cost? It doesn't feel like a victory."
\"It's a victory for him," Devdutt replied quietly. "Let's honor him."
Later, in his apartment, overlooking the rust-colored Martian landscape, Kohli sat alone. Anushka found him, her presence a quiet comfort. "I don't know if I can keep doing this, Anushka," he said, his voice heavy with unspoken words, "Not without him."
Anushka sat beside him, her hand resting on his. "You don't have to decide tonight. Honor his memory by making the choice that's best for you."
