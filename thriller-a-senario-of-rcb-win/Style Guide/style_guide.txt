## Sample Paragraph

The roar of the Ahmedabad crowd was a physical force, a wave of sound threatening to wash over the RCB players as they took to the field.  Each man carried the weight of years of near-misses, of broken promises, the ghosts of past failures clinging to them like a shroud. But tonight, under the unforgiving glare of the stadium lights, something felt different.  A quiet determination, forged in the fires of adversity, burned in their eyes. It was the quiet before the storm, a hush before the heart-stopping crescendo of redemption.
