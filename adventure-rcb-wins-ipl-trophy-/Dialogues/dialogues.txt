Kohli frowned. "Different how?"

Sanjay chuckled, a bitter, humorless sound.  "You finally figured it out, Kohli?  After all these years of success, you have no one to blame but yourselves."

"This wasn't about success or failure, Sanjay. This was about sabotaging your teammates, your friends.  Why?"

There's been sabotage, injuries... but we are here.  We've fought our way to this moment.  Mumbai is waiting. They think we're finished, broken. Let's show them what RCB is really made of."

AB de Villiers nodded, a calm smile playing on his lips. "Twenty years of heartbreak. Let's rewrite history, together."

Aniket, his eyes shining with fierce determination, spoke quietly, "For RCB!"
