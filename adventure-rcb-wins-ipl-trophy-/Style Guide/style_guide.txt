## Sample Paragraph

The Mumbai night throbbed with a million heartbeats, a feverish energy that mirrored the tension coiling in Virat's gut.  The stadium lights, a blinding galaxy, cast long shadows on the manicured pitch.  He felt the weight of twenty years of defeat, the hopes of millions, crushing down on his shoulders.  A single, misplaced throw, a missed catch, the smallest misstep, and it could all be over.  He rubbed his sweaty palms, his eyes scanning the faces in the dugout, searching for a sign of wavering resolve, a flicker of doubt. He found none.  Tonight, the tide would turn.
